								I had the privilege of working at ESRI in Redlands, California during the summer months of 2014. I worked in the Technical Marketing department which specializes in creating custom demonstrations of ESRI technologies to cater to different industries. This team works to come alongside GIS users and help them envision how ESRI products could improve their company's work.
							</p>
					        <p>
					        	I focused on putting together demos for utilities and telecom companies. I gained a solid understanding of how these types of companies use GIS and how their industries operate. This experience offered me the valuable opportunity to work with many different software products including ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS for Server, GeoEvent Processor, Operations Dashboard, ESRI Maps for Office, and ArcGIS Pro.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	The internship gave me both a better grasp on what ESRI does as a whole and the scope of the entire geospatial industry. Throughout the internship I had the chance to hear from and interact with members of many different teams at ESRI. I learned about the different arms of ESRI and their individual roles. I had the invaluable experience of working at the ESRI User Conference in San Diego. I enjoyed seeing the amazing ways users are leveraging ESRI technologies at both the plenary and smaller exhibitions, and I took the time to walk around the exhibition hall and chat with different vendors. The inventive work of others was thought-provoking and energizing.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	My time in Redlands is not one I will soon forget, and I am thankful for the skills and relationships I developed that will carry on after the summer.

								I serve as an assistant to the doctoral research of Sterling Quinn in the Penn State Department of Geography. I am aiding Sterling in his work investigating the implementation of OpenStreetMap, a sort of Wikipedia of maps,  in Latin America. We are interested in OpenStreetMap's popularity in different countries and profiling its contributors. This position has given me a better understanding of the research process and afforded me the opportunity to develop additional technical GIS skills. My main responsibility has been data processing, writing Python scripts to manipulate CSVs, XML, and shapefiles. For example, I have written scripts to count how many edits map contributors have made and scripts to create shapefiles from OSM data in CSVs. I have also worked with command-line utilities and QGIS. Most recently, I have been doing some Python scripting in QGIS to manipulate PostGIS layers. I began this position in January of 2014 and am continuing as an assistant this spring semester.

								This semester I am working as a research assistant on the <a href="http://www.geovista.psu.edu/stempo/">STempo project</a>. The goal of the STempo project is to develop and implement computational tools for revealing complex associations in reported events. My main responsibilies include creating a quick-start guide to orient new users to the software and conducting the usability study of STempo. This position has been a great opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants by working with graduate students and senior faculty; I have learned so much just by watching how they think, communicate, and problem solve. It has been an enjoyable experience to be a part of the software development process.

								During the fall semester of 2013 I worked at the Borough of State College Planning Department providing GIS and mapping services. I primarily created maps and data layers to enable the Borough to get a better sense of its community from demographics to housing to transportation. This experience provided me with a good feel for the goals and work of a local government. I was more or less the resident "GIS expert" at the Borough so I had to be resourceful and think independently. I enjoyed seeing and being a part of all the work and thoughtful planning the Borough conducted to ensure State College remained a healthy, thriving community.
